# Paddle Payments Integration Architecture

## Overview of Paddle Implementation in Next.js Starter Kit

The Paddle Billing starter kit for Next.js demonstrates a complete SaaS subscription system with these key components:

### Core Architecture

1. **Authentication Layer (Supabase)**
   - User registration/login
   - Session management
   - Anonymous checkout support

2. **Paddle Integration**
   - Client-side: `paddle-js` for pricing display and checkout
   - Server-side: `paddle-node-sdk` for API operations
   - Webhook handler for event synchronization

3. **Database Schema**
   - Customers table (maps Paddle customer_id to email)
   - Subscriptions table (stores subscription data from webhooks)

4. **Key Flows**
   - Pricing display with localization
   - Checkout process
   - Subscription management
   - Payment history

## Implementation Components

### 1. Environment Configuration
```
PADDLE_API_KEY - Server-side API key
PADDLE_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_SECRET - Webhook verification
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENV - Environment (sandbox/production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN - Client-side token
```

### 2. Critical Files/Functions

- **Client-Side Integration**
  - `usePaddlePrices` hook - Fetches localized pricing
  - `initializePaddle` - Setup for checkout and pricing
  - `CheckoutContents` - Embedded checkout implementation

- **Server-Side Operations**
  - `getSubscription/getSubscriptions` - Retrieve subscription data
  - `getTransactions` - Payment history
  - `cancelSubscription` - Subscription management
  - Webhook handler (`process-webhook.ts`) - Syncs data from Paddle events

- **Database Sync**
  - Customer creation/updates
  - Subscription state changes
  - Transaction recording

## Required Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Paddle Account**
   - Create sandbox account for testing
   - Configure products and pricing tiers
   - Generate API keys and client tokens

2. **Database Schema**
   - Create customers and subscriptions tables
   - Setup proper foreign key relationships
   - Add policies for authenticated access

3. **Core Components**
   - Pricing display component with localization
   - Checkout flow integration
   - Subscription management dashboard
   - Payment history view

4. **Webhook Integration**
   - Create webhook endpoint
   - Implement signature verification
   - Process subscription events
   - Sync data to database

5. **Customer Portal**
   - Dashboard with subscription overview
   - Payment method management
   - Subscription upgrade/downgrade
   - Cancellation workflow

## Integration Recommendations

1. Start with a minimal implementation focusing on:
   - Basic pricing display
   - Checkout integration
   - Webhook handler

2. Implement subscription management:
   - View active subscriptions
   - Cancel subscription functionality
   - Payment history

3. Enhance with:
   - Customer portal with complete management
   - Localization support
   - Upgrade/downgrade paths

4. Test all flows thoroughly in sandbox environment before switching to production

This architecture separates client and server responsibilities while maintaining data consistency through the webhook system. All subscription state is managed by Paddle with your database serving as a mirror of relevant information.
