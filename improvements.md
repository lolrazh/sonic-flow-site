# Next.js Best Practices: Optimization Opportunities

## 1. App Router & Pages Router Coexistence (Major Improvement - High Priority)

Your project is using both the App Router (`src/app`) and the Pages Router (`src/pages`). This dual setup creates unnecessary complexity and potential for confusion.

**Recommendation:** Fully migrate to the App Router since you're on Next.js 15. This provides better performance through React Server Components, more intuitive routing, and future-proofing.

## 2. File Structure Organization (Medium Improvement)

While your directory structure follows some conventions, it could be optimized:

**Recommendations:**
- Move reusable UI components from `src/components/landing` to more general-purpose directories
- Separate UI components based on domain or functionality rather than just "shared" vs "landing"
- Consider adopting atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms) for UI components

## 3. React Server Components (Major Improvement)

There's no clear indication of intentional usage of React Server Components vs Client Components.

**Recommendations:**
- Mark client-only components with "use client" directive
- Keep server components as the default (no directive) for better performance
- Separate data fetching from UI rendering with server components

## 4. Data Fetching Patterns (Medium Improvement)

Your codebase likely has various data fetching patterns using Supabase and tRPC.

**Recommendations:**
- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Implement proper caching strategies using React Cache
- Adopt consistent fetch patterns across similar components

## 5. tRPC Implementation (Medium Improvement)

Your tRPC setup appears to be based on older patterns and could benefit from newer approaches.

**Recommendations:**
- Update to use the latest tRPC patterns with App Router
- Implement server actions where appropriate instead of tRPC for simple operations
- Consider using tRPC procedures as React Server Component functions when possible

## 6. Image Optimization (Minor Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all images use Next.js's `<Image>` component
- Configure proper image sizing and priorities
- Implement responsive images with multiple sizes

## 7. Fonts & Styling (Minor Improvement)

You're using Google Fonts correctly with the Next.js font system, but there could be optimization opportunities:

**Recommendations:**
- Pre-load only essential font weights
- Consider using variable fonts where possible
- Use CSS variables consistently for theming

## 8. Route Handling (Medium Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper loading states for all routes (loading.tsx)
- Add error boundaries with error.tsx files
- Use parallel routes for complex UIs where needed

## 9. Authentication Flow (Medium Improvement)

Your authentication with Supabase could potentially benefit from:

**Recommendations:**
- Implement server-side authentication checks
- Use middleware for protected routes
- Optimize client-side auth state management

## 10. Project Configuration (Minor Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Review and optimize your next.config.js settings
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Consider adding performance monitoring

## 11. Component Reusability (Medium Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Create more reusable components to reduce duplication
- Implement consistent prop patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props

## 12. Performance Optimization (Medium-High Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper code splitting with dynamic imports
- Add suspense boundaries for async operations
- Use streaming server rendering where appropriate
- Implement proper caching headers

## 13. API Route Organization (Minor Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Organize API routes by domain/feature
- Implement consistent error handling
- Add proper request validation

## 14. Build and Bundle Optimization (Medium Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Review and remove unused dependencies
- Implement proper tree shaking
- Consider implementing module/nomodule pattern for modern browsers

## 15. TypeScript Integration (Minor Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure strict TypeScript checks are enabled
- Implement proper type sharing between client and server
- Use zod for runtime validation and type generation

## 16. Environment Variables (Minor Improvement)

**Recommendations:**
- Properly segregate client-side and server-side environment variables
- Implement validation for required environment variables
